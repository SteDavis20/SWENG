# SWENG
This assignment is to implement a function to find the lowest common ancestor in a graph. The assignment is broken into 2 parts:

    Part 1 - Implement solution for binary trees using 2 languages
    
    Part 2 - Upgrade solution to handle directed acyclic graphs aswell as binary trees

# Part 1 - Binary Trees (2 Languages)
Initial solution handled binary trees, where solution is provided in 2 languages:

        1: Java (Strongest language)
        
        2: Python (New language)
        
# Part 2 - Directed Acyclic Graphs (1 Language)
I have upgraded my solution for finding the lowest common ancestor to now handle directed acyclic graphs aswell as binary trees. The assignment specification specifies that we only continue our solution using 1 language, the language we are mot comfortable with from part 1. I continued my solution using java to cover directed acyclic graphs, and have not continued with python.

Language used:

      Java
